            <h4>Club Login</h4>
            <p>A basic but greatly important feature. Students can register and login to create and edit their club information. While your student admin can also login with a unique account to interact with the clubs all within the portal.</p>

          <div>
            <h4>Clubs List</h4>
            <p>A clubs list that is automatically updated as clubs are registered or edited. The Club's List will require no manual adding from the admin side. Extremely easy to list hundreds of clubs with their logos, descriptions, social links, and more, that requires no work from you.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>Communication</h4>
            <p>Easily send and receive notifications within the Portal with simple clicks. No more back and forth emails. A club want's to request a name change? They click the name change button on the portal, and you'll get a notification that you can approve or deny. Simple.</p>

          <div>
            <h4>Smart Forms</h4>
            <p>Say goodbye to using Google Forms. The Portal will have all it's forms built in that will effectively store the data, including files and images. Everything on the Portal will be easily accessed and editable for clubs and admin.</p>

            <h4>Plus More</h4>
            <p>We understand that every University manages their clubs a little different, so we'll design the Portal for your needs. If you want a special feature or a certain design to match your existing methods, we'll get it done.</p>
